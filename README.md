# `casey`

> A simple command line tool to uppercase and lowercase strings.

This `README.md` is written as a tutorial. If you're just interested in using this package, you'll find the usage information first. In the second part I'll explain how this package was created. This should be helpful, if you want to create a similar package or if you want to contribute to this package.

## Usage

To use this program make sure you have [Rust installed with `rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org) (and you'll also need [Git](https://git-scm.com/)). This program uses stable Rust. Run the following steps to download the source code, compile it and run the program:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:donaldpipowitch/casey.git
$ cd casey
$ cargo run
```

You can than start to type any string. This string will be camel cased immediately in the following line and lower cased in the line after that. Note that this program currently doesn't handle multilines well.

Here is an example of what you would see:

```bash
heLLo WOrld!
HELLO WORLD!
hello world!
```

## Contribute

In this section I want to take about how this program was created, so you are able to create similar projets, fork this project or contribute back to it. I'm happy if you can point out any spelling mistakes as I'm not a native english speaker. In general you're allowed to contribute features back to this project (e.g. like multiline support), but keep in mind that I'll only accepts pull requests if this _"Contribute"_ section is kept in sync with the changes. I hope you'll enjoy the read ðŸ‘‹

To start make sure to have the same prequisites as mentioned in the _"Usage"_ section, namigly have [Rust installed with `rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org).

I started the project by creating an empty directory and adding some basic files to it for my initial setup.

The [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) is the same we get by running `$ cargo init` (see [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), if you want to know more about `.gitignore` files):

```
/target
**/*.rs.bk
```

The [`Cargo.toml`](.Cargo.toml) is _nearly_ the same we get by running `$ cargo init` (see [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html), if you want to know more about `Cargo.toml` files). The one thing which was added was [`termion`](https://github.com/redox-os/termion) as our only dependency. `termion` is needed to create a REPL-like application. As mentioned in the _"Usage"_ section we want to _immediately_ show some transformed output of the user input. `termion` will cover the needs for this like clearing lines or moving the cursor in the terminal. [Because of a bug](https://github.com/redox-os/termion/issues/140#issuecomment-387376756) I actually specified to use the Git source of this crate. (Thank you @JoshMcguigan for the bug fix!):

```
[package]
name = "casey"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Donald Pipowitch <pipo@senaeh.de>"]

[dependencies]
termion = {git = "https://github.com/redox-os/termion"}
```

Thanks for reading so far. I'd be happy to get feedback about this _"Tutorial as a `README.md`"_ format. It is an experiment to teach coding. I'd also be happy if you can point out
